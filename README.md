# Email Spam Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project implements machine learning algorithms to classify emails as spam or non-spam. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Files
- **emails.csv**: Dataset with email content and labels.
- **prepare.ipynb**: Load and preprocess data.
- **train.ipynb**: Train, score, and evaluate models.

## Dataset
- `emails.csv`: This dataset contains a collection of email text messages, labeled as either spam or not spam. Each email message is associated with a binary label, where "1" indicates that the email is spam, and "0" indicates that it is not spam. The dataset is intended for use in training and evaluating spam email classification models.
